<h3>Summary</h3>




<p>Geodesics in Heat is a new approach to computing distance based on heat flow picked up by Professor Crane in 2013. Though its performance exhibits a lower computational cost than older methods like fast marching and exact polyhedral  distance, a paralleled implementation is still vacant. In this project, I am going to accomplish a parallel implementation in Geodesics in Heat on Intel Core i7.

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h3>
<p>The Geodesics in Heat problem could be divided into 3 basic steps for a fixed time t:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Integrate the heat flow for some fixed time t</li>
  <li> Evaluate the vector field</li>
  <li> Solve the Poisson equation </li>
</ul>
<p>Among which the first part heat equation and the third part Poisson equation are both linear equations, and therefore could be solved by plugging into a paralleled linear solver. Various paralleled solvers could be adopted according to the inputs. The process of introducing the matrices, however, still needs parallelization. What is more, some iterative scheme may be needed to further improve the accuracy of this method. Our goal is to first solve the parallel problem in introducing the matrices, then use iterative scheme to further improve the method’s accuracy. We would expand the method to other objects like grids and point clouds if have time.

<a id="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Challenge</h3>
<p>The accuracy of the heat method depends on the particular choice of spatial discretization, so we need to take convergence into consideration when choosing the appropriate solvers.

<p>I chose to work on Intel Core i7 because the code I'm working on is based on OpenMP.
