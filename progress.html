<h3> Environment Setup (April 5 - 8) </h3>

<p>I first set up the environment to make sure the benchmark code could run smoothly on the Mac.  Specifically, I installed <a target="_blank" href ="http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/">the HSL_MA87 library</a> to get all the parallel sparse linear solvers work.</p>

<p> The HSL_MA87 library is dependent on the following 3 libraries:</p>
<ul>
	<li>BLAS</li>
	<li><a target="_blank" href ="http://www.netlib.org/lapack">LAPACK</a></li>
	<li><a target="_blank" href ="http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/views/metis">MeTiS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Which also have been installed.</p>


<h3> Testing the Benchmark Code (April 9 - 11) </h3>

<p>I tested the benchmark code against a few .obj files and all could run smoothly on the set up environment.</p>

<h3> Implementation (April 12 - Present) </h3>
<ul>
	<li>Combined reduplicated parts of the for loop;</li>
	<li>Paralleled all the for loops without race conditions;</li>
</ul>

<h3>Project Goals and Parallelism Competition (Present - May 7) </h3>
<p>I believe that I will be able to produce and show a CPU implementation of the accelerated Geodesic in Heat method for triangle meshes. Once it is done, I will go on to the point cloud and grid parts.</p>
